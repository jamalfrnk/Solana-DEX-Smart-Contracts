//1. Define State: The verifier contract needs minimal state, as it mostly performs checks.

//2. Implement verify_liquidity_pool: Check the pool's reserves and liquidity.

//3. Implement verify_trade: Verify that a trade was executed correctly according to the pool's rules.

/*Explanation of the Implementation:
Step 1: Fetch the pool's state
The get_liquidity_pool function retrieves the liquidity pool's current state, including the token reserves before the trade is executed.

Step 2: Identify the input and output tokens
The input and output tokens are identified from the trade details. If the token_in provided does not match either of the tokens in the liquidity pool, we return an error.

Step 3: Verify the Constant Product Invariant
The Constant Product rule for a CPMM states that after a trade, the product of the new reserves should be greater than or equal to the product of the old reserves:

(new_reserve_in⋅new_reserve_out)≥(old_reserve_in⋅old_reserve_out)

If the product decreases, the trade is invalid.

Step 4: Verify the Output Amount
The output amount is recalculated based on the input amount and the current pool reserves using the constant product formula. If the actual output does not match the expected output, an error is returned.

Step 5: Handle Slippage Tolerance (Optional)
If a slippage tolerance mechanism is in place, the output is checked against the maximum allowed slippage. If the trade exceeds this tolerance, it would fail.

Step 6: Ensure User Balances Are Correct (Optional)
Optionally, you could also check the user's balance to ensure that the expected input and output amounts were properly deducted and credited.*/
